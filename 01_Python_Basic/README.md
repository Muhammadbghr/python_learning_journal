# 🐍 Python Basics

Welcome to my Python Basics repository!

This section contains a collection of fundamental Python exercises and mini-projects I’ve built as part of my journey into programming and data analysis.

## 📌 What's inside?

- Core Python syntax and structures  
- Functions, loops, and conditionals  
- File handling  
- Basic OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)  
- Simple real-world mini-projects  

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to document my learning process while building a strong foundation in Python.  
Every script here represents a small step forward—whether it’s a new concept, a solved bug, or a cleaner way to write code.

## 🚀 Why this matters

I believe in learning by doing. This repo is a space where I grow in public—mistakes, revisions, improvements and all.  
Your feedback is always welcome!
