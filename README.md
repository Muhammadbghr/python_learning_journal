# Python Learning Journal

I’m documenting every step of my Python journey—sharing code examples, insights,  
and screenshots so clients and collaborators can follow along.

## Roadmap

1.  Basic Python concepts  
2.  Data analysis with NumPy, pandas, and visualization  
3.  Integrating Python scripts into Power BI dashboards  

### How to Navigate

- Browse folders in numerical order  
- Read each folder’s `README.md` for context  
- Explore code files and Jupyter notebooks for examples
